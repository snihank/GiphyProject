# GiphyProject

This project is mainly based on GIPHY image search. The user would only type anything they want to search in the search bar and 10 moving images appear with respective ratings. However, the images should stop moving on click and start moving again on click. The user can save the moving images and can also use them in message apps.

The app is written in HTML and Javascript & jQuery, styled with CSS and Bootstrap. In addition, GitHub is used for collaboration and go live, besides VS Code as the editor.
